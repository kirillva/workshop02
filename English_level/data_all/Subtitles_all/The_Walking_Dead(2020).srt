which is a vital part of our reality.

709
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,280
In our world...

710
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,802
...genes have an almost
spiritual significance.

711
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,883
They are the seeds of our immortality.

712
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,880
When the exact...

713
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,331
...same genes reappear...

714
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,001
...in the exact same order...

715
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,686
...it is for us what you
would call reincarnation.

716
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,811
But how could I be a reincarnation of your
mother unless your mother was from Earth?

717
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,327
My mother was born
before your first cities were built.

718
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,769
Are you some kind of vampire race?

719
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,891
KALIQUE: We are the cause
of a lot of those myths, but I promise...

720
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,407
...my mother was just as human as you or I.

721
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,769
The difference between us
is our knowledge and technology.

722
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,643
How old do you think...

723
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,365
...I am?
- Um...

724
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,446
Late forties?

725
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,726
I recently celebrated my 14th millennium.

726
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,446
You're 14,000 years old?

727
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,610
Fourteen thousand and four, to be precise.

728
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,006
My mother was approaching
her 91st millennium when she passed.

729
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,728
You'd be just as amazed
how quickly it goes.

JUPITER:
If your lives are so long...

731
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,242
...could I ask
how your mother actually died?

732
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,689
She was murdered.

733
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,529
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

734
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,643
- Did they ever find out who did it?
- No.

735
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,162
My mother and I did not always get along.

736
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,411
I hope this Recurrence might mean
a second chance for both of us.

737
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,080
Come.

740
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,400
Holy crap.

00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:17,803
KALIQUE:
Each of us has...

742
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,880
...a code for our optimal
physical condition.

743
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,600
The problem is...

744
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,809
...our genes have an expiration date
which is transferred to our cells.

745
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,128
A long time ago, someone figured out...

746
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,442
...how to replace deteriorating cells
with new ones.

747
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,007
Today, it's as easy as
changing a light bulb.

748

Where do you get these light bulbs?

749
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,720
You grow them.

750
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,127
Like clones?

751
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,407
No.

752
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,728
Clones lack genetic plasticity.

753
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,360
Several million years ago,
a gene plague caused by cloning...

754
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,284
...nearly annihilated
the entire human race.

755
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,527
I was told that the House of Abrasax
seeded the Earth.

756
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,851
Is that where you get it?

757
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,728
Your Earth is a very small part
of a very large industry.

Wow.

00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,922
In your world, people are used to
fighting for resources...

761
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,049
...like oil, or minerals, or land.

762
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,486
But when you have access
to the vastness of space...

763
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,809
...you realize there's only one resource
worth fighting over...

764
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,288
...even killing for:

765
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,366
More time.

766
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,685

precious commodity...

Sorry, I just don't understand what you mean
when you say "claim your Title."

773
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,769
It's common for people
in the First Estate...

774
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,651
...to leave a trust
for any potential Recurrence.

775
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,330
My mother wrote her future
self into her will.

776
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,369
Right now, Balem owns the Title to Earth...

777

the Earth will belong to you.

How can one person own the Earth?

00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,481
It's just a planet, Jupiter.

780
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,447
In this world, people own things
far more valuable.

the lives of your family for the better.
