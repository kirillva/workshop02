Episode 1

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,410
Good morning.

5
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,950
Good morning.

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,240
Good morning.

7
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,930
Could you put it over there?

8
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,740
We're preparing for the wedding tomorrow.

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,300
Really?

10
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,380
Welcome to World.

11
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,760
Get out.

12
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,560
Don't cry!

13
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,590
These little...

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,540
Hey, don't cry!
Go, go, go, go!

15
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,550
They're both dead!

16
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,100
The man and woman who just came here,
what room are they in?

17
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm sorry, according to regulations we
cannot give out that information.

18
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,590
Tell me what room they're in! Tell me!

19
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,990
- First, please calm yourself.
- How can I calm down?

20
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,070
Those two people... are my fiancï¿½
and my closest friend!

21
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,610
Look! They're getting married here tomorrow!

22
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,570
<i>What room are they in!</i>

23
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,610
Don't cry! If you cry, you lose!
Are you an idiot!

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,640
- What room are they in?
- I'm sorry,

25
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,160
we must maintain our guest's privacy.

26
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,810
"Privacy?"

27
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,470
<i>Tell them.</i>

28
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,730
You don't stick to regulation in these
situations.

29
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,410
- Hey, what are you hesitating for?
- I'll do it.

30
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,240
Wait, wait!

31
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,200
If I confirm it now... there probably
won't be a wedding tomorrow, right?

32
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,180
The deposit for the wedding hall,

33
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,530
marriage expenses, gifts to the groom,

34
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,710
the honeymoon,
they all have to be cancelled!

35
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,020
I didn't even rent the dress
and it was tailored for me.

36
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,260
What do I do about all that?

37
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,920
<i>The majority of women, marry not the man,
but the idea of the wedding.</i>

38
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,130
Is that what's important here?

39
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,050
What do I need to do?

40
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,270
It's better to just not look, right?

41
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,980
You think that way too, right?

42
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,870
What are you doing?
Who are you to do that?

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,540
It's my hotel.

44
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,170
Hey, hey!
Get her! Get her!

45
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,810
What is it?

46
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,610
Thank you for staying at our hotel.

47
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,200
Do you by any chance have any complaints?

48
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,360
Lots.

49
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,860
I ordered room service a while ago,
why hasn't it arrived yet?

50
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,620
And, what's wrong with your timing?

51
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,210
This isn't your first or second day
in business!

52
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,000
<i>This is room service!</i>

53
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,050
- What is this!
- You bastard!

54
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,180
Hey, hey! This is a misunderstanding!

55
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,320
<i>What are you doing!</i>

56
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,460
<i>It's a misunderstanding! A misunderstanding!</i>

57
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,560
Take care of it.

58
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,950
<i>Misunderstand? What bull.</i>

59
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,830
<i>Pull all her hair out!</i>

60
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,370
- My hair!
- Ten minutes later.

61
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,080
And take the lady to her house.

62
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,130
<i>We were studying!</i>

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,930
<i>Do you study with your clothes off!</i>

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
<i>She's right, we were studying!</i>

65
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,970
<i>Where are you running off to!</i>

66
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,060
<i>In September of 2009,</i>

67
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,110
<i>the UN World Tourism Organization chose to</i>

68
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,320
<i>hold the T20 Tourism Ministerial Meeting
in Korea,</i>

69
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,870
and it's an honor to hold it in this place
where the history...

70
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,550
<i>and culture of Korea thrives.</i>

71
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,280
Lastly, to all the attendees at this
meaningful event,

72
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,900
<i>I'd like to present traditional
Korean dance.</i>

73
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,110
So sweet honey, wow!

74
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,150
Yes, this is Korean traditional honey.

75
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,130
Everyone's loving it.
The best event.

76
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,980
Of course, whose idea was it?

77
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,790
Stop acting like you're so much
better than us.

78
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,210
I'm hungry.

79
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,450
You haven't eaten lunch?

80
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,920
I haven't even eaten breakfast.

81
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,210
But on days like this, even when
I don't eat I'm full.

82
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,310
You have nerves of steel.
I thought I was going to die of nervousness.

83
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,630
Really?

84
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,510
Stay still! Stay still, stay still!

85
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,970
I got it!

86
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,800
The minister is coming this way.

87
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,920
- Really?
- Awesome! Awesome!

88
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,570
There are so many bees.

89
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,340
<i>What are you doing? Hurry and come out!</i>

90
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,150
<i>All right, okay.</i>

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,510
Whose idea was this?

92
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,170
Yes... that is... I mean...

93
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,720
- I, after much difficulty...
- It's mine.

94
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,940
What's your name?

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,800
I'm part of the Tourism Division,
Kong Ah Jung.

96
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,730
You're responsible for this?

97
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Yes.

98
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,490
Then, it must've been your idea.

99
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,290
That's... right.

100
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,820
Your concept is impressive.

101
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,790
To open a national event at a place
like this.

102
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,600
When the event is over, please take care of

103
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,230
accommodations for the guests as well.

104
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,610
All you need is one nice hotel.

105
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,600
Kong Ah Jung, good job.

106
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,900
From now on continue like this.

107
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,080
Thank you.

108
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,690
The Ministry of Culture's Tourism Division,

109
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:57,190
our Cultural Tourism Board has organized
various events... Oh...

110
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,250
What is this!

111
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,330
What do you take Korea's civil
administrators as!?

112
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,190
It's honey!

113
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,380
Hey! Don't move, don't move, don't move!

114
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,880
Everyone! Everyone, it's all...

115
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,990
Everyone!

116
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,310
Everyone!

117
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,830
Everyone!!

118
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,440
Please calm down!

119
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,100
It's all right!
Please calm down!

120
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,780
Don't come here!

121
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,410
Hey!
Go!

122
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,770
Go!

123
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,040
Everyone, calm down!
It's really all right!

124
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,340
Where should I take you?

125
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,840
Where should I go?

126
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,600
- Let's go to the city first.
- All right.

127
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,290
Are there bees in here?
Why do I keep hearing buzzing.

128
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,690
Softly, softly...

129
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,120
You did a great job.
Great job.

130
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,450
You were fretting to stick out.

131
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,210
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,790
Sorry?

133
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,670
The minister is still at the hospital,

134
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,410
how are you going to take responsibility?

135
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,250
First, we should meet the person in charge
at the Ministry of Culture.

136
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,760
<i>Hey! Kong Ah Jung!</i>

137
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,520
Who are you trying to blame?

138
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,180
You were the one responsible for this event.

139
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,530
I'm not trying to blame anyone.

140
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,790
Think about it, how can I take
responsibility for the wasp nest there?

141
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,330
That is naturally the responsibility
of the caretakers,

142
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,520
and the Cultural Heritage Administration
should explain that!

143
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,910
Write a letter of apology.

144
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,210
You're too much.

145
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,440
What's too much?

146
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,080
Participants of the event, tourists,

147
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,210
altogether thirty people have gone
to the emergency room.

148
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,670
What's too much?

149
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,260
Why are you overstepping your bounds
and aggravating so many people?

150
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,480
If you live according to your status,
it's good for you, good for me,

151
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:34,800
and good for everyone else.

152
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,070
What a terrible idea... there's not one
thing you can do correctly!

153
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,810
Are you feeling good?

154
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,110
Now that things have turned out like this?

155
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,250
If you think a letter of apology is
too much, write a letter of resignation!

156
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,880
Ms. Kong, please put on some medicine!

157
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,260
The poison can be dangerous!

158
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,370
I'm fine.

159
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,130
Ms. Kong!
Ms. Kong!

160
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,840
Sang Hee oppa!

161
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,310
When did you come back?

162
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,880
When did you come back?

163
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,060
Have you been well?

164
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,110
Why haven't you been in contact
all this time?

165
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,410
You've gotten prettier.

166
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,870
Really?

167
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,150
It must've cost quite a bit.

168
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,470
No, it's because of the lighting here.

169
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,710
Who cares? Having it before you're married
is good common sense.

170
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,780
You're definitely different.

171
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,090
Oppa... I got engaged.

172
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,970
Congratulations.

173
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,750
Didn't you say you were going to
wait for me?

174
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,970
You haven't even called me.

175
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,620
Oppa, let's have a kiss.

176
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,480
Didn't you say you were engaged?

177
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,250
Hey! Is this a room of your house
or a motel?

178
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,770
You're breaking my concentration,
so go away.

179
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,890
Go!

180
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,210
Go away, go!

181
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,030
What's with this woman.

182
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,270
Why is it so loud.

183
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,630
Quiet.
Be quiet!

184
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,360
Now it's a bit better.

185
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,000
<i>Oppa, she's a crazy woman, a crazy woman.</i>

186
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,840
Let's go somewhere else.

187
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,140
It's become more fun.

188
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,080
I think it was a good idea to come back.

189
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,460
Park Hoon, I told you to rest at home
after getting off from work.

190
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,930
What?

191
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,760
Are you sure?

192
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,210
Where?

193
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,920
He's where right now?

194
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,900
No, I can go by myself.
Stay put!

195
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,070
I can't do it any longer!

196
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,060
What are you looking at?

197
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,080
What are you doing right now?

198
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,300
Can't you see?
I'm writing my resignation.

199
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,340
Resignation?
Here?

200
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,900
Why can't I?

201
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,880
- Are you going to stay there?
- Am I interfering?

202
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,720
You've never written a resignation, right?

203
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,800
Looking at the way you're dressed,
you're not even employed.

204
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,330
This is a really sensitive job.

205
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,060
It seems so.

206
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,440
But... why are you writing your
resignation on a napkin?

207
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,770
Then where should I write it?

208
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,470
They say they only have things
like this here.

209
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,790
A napkin resignation probably
won't look very serious.

210
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,830
Isn't it better than a coaster?

211
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,530
That's true.

212
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,750
Suddenly these bees were flying around!

213
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,120
How could I have taken responsibility
for a hornet's nest?

214
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,000
Do bees listen to my words?

215
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,000
Am I god?

216
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,850
It's worth getting angry over.

217
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,540
But... writing a resignation because you
were asked to write a letter of apology

218
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,770
is going overboard, don't you think?

219
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,840
I didn't do anything wrong.

220
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,250
Telling me to even write a letter of apology
was going overboard.

221
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,670
Another one of these.

222
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,770
Will you be okay?

223
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,770
Don't worry.

224
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,930
But you're drunk.

225
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,420
No I'm not.

226
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,470
Why am I like this today?

227
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,390
Is it because I got angry?

228
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,320
I need to snap out of it.

229
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,500
Oh, you're fast.

230
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,620
"Letter of resignation"...

231
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:14,890
"My awesome self is resigning...
don't live like that, you punks!"

232
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,000
"Kong Ah Jung."

233
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,380
What do you think?
Awesome, right?

234
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,500
- Your name's Ah Jung?
- No,

235
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,840
how is the content?

236
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,370
You're really going to hand it in like this?

237
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,710
No.

238
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,060
I'm going to... blow my nose...
and throw it to him!

239
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,840
How dirty.

240
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,360
Dirty. He said it's dirty! Dirty!

241
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,540
You're really funny.

242
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,770
He sure is fast.

243
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,470
It's only been a few hours
since I arrived in Seoul.

244
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,560
I feel so refreshed!

245
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,670
I wish Monday would come quick so I can
throw in my resignation.

246
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,710
My resignation...

247
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,750
Where...
My resignation!

248
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,160
<i>Oppa!</i>

249
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,010
You're already leaving?

250
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,700
We're going to Donghae.
Let's go together!

251
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,470
Sounds good!

252
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,480
Hyun Sang Hee!

253
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,970
<i>Hey, you thief!</i>

254
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,240
Hey! You stole my resignation!

255
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,530
If I catch you you're dead!

256
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,410
Really!

257
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,020
I'm a government employee!
Korea's first class government...

258
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,130
Do you know Hyun Sang Hee?

259
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,400
Look here!

260
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,690
Just... let go!

261
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,240
Let go!

262
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,690
<i>Oh no, what's happening?</i>

263
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,770
<i>- What's wrong with that woman?
- What do we do?</i>

264
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,770
<i>Wasn't that person on TV?</i>

265
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,910
<i>- I think he's a famous person!
- Look at him! Look at him carefully!</i>

266
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,630
<i>- I don't think so.
- He's right, he's right.</i>

267
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,340
<i>- He's right?
- What do we do?</i>

268
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,180
<i>What a weird person.</i>

269
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,130
<i>She's unconscious.</i>

270
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,700
Look here!

271
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,680
Look here!
You can't sleep here!

272
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,780
Look here!

273
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,230
Look here!

274
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,910
They said she was drunk and was passed out
in front of a club in Kangnam.

275
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,130
<i>It's been about ten minutes.</i>

276
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,570
Apart from alcohol, any drugs?

277
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,020
Did she take any hallucinogens?

278
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,050
I don't know, it's the first time I'm
seeing her, too.

279
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,730
- Move her.
- Yes.

280
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,380
The guardian should fill out
her information.

281
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,410
I'm not her guardian.

282
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,230
<i>He's good-looking.</i>

283
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,090
<i>Who is he?</i>

284
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,980
Nurse... Nurse!

285
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,900
Name? Say your name.

286
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,200
Kong Ah Jung.

287
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,890
Call out your resident registration number.

288
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,980
841017206812...

289
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,960
But, why am I here?

290
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,880
It's acute alcohol poisoning.

291
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,170
Acute alcohol poisoning?

292
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,510
Haven't you ever had alcohol shock before?

293
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,370
Yes.

294
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,730
Any drugs?
Perhaps, hallucinogens?

295
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,040
I don't do things like that.

296
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,220
I'll stake my life on it, I'd never
do such things.

297
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,840
By any chance, did you get stung by a bee?

298
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,780
Yes, I was stung by a wasp yesterday.

299
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,960
Is it because of that?

300
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,480
It looks like it.

301
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,900
How ridiculous.

302
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,400
Depending on the person, the poison
and alcohol can have an adverse affect.

303
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,430
It could've been very bad,
you could've died.

304
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,860
Die?

305
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,960
You're okay now, so rest a bit and then
you can leave.

306
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,610
Is he crazy?

307
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,590
How can I rest when I almost died?

308
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,190
Am I really okay?

309
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,120
Oh no! I'm feverish!
I'm hot!

310
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,560
<i>You want to eat some?</i>

311
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,740
Thank you.

312
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,660
But, I don't know if I can eat this
right now.

313
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,260
Then give that to your husband.

314
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,170
What?

315
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,220
That good-looking young man I saw before,
isn't he your husband?

316
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,250
No, he's someone I don't know.

317
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,680
But he was looking over you the entire
night, I thought he was your husband.

318
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,700
He was looking over me all night?

319
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,380
He was sitting completely still like this.

320
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,730
But really, do you really not know him?

321
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,270
You're awake!

322
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,830
Your husband, where is he?

323
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,680
I said he's not my husband.

324
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,290
See? He's not her husband,
it's her boyfriend.

325
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,480
It's a relief, now that your girlfriend
has woken up.

326
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,060
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Yes she is.

327
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,260
Who are you?

328
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,540
I don't expect much, but I waited
just in case.

329
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,770
The man you met yesterday at the club...

330
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,880
Could you... please button that?

331
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,500
It's itchy...

332
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,300
What is this..

333
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,480
There's no way.

334
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,770
What kind of guy is he.

335
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,850
But, what about the club?

336
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,290
It's fine.

337
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,470
What is?

338
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,910
Guardian? One moment.

339
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,030
I said I'm not her guardian.

340
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,780
You remember that man who was with me,
he was tall...

341
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,120
Oh, your guardian?

342
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,590
- He went to check you out.
- Yes, but he's not...

343
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,020
Why isn't he here?

344
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,970
He can't just... leave.

345
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,590
<i>Excuse me!</i>

346
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,940
<i>Excuse me!
Excuse me!</i>

347
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,480
Excuse me!

348
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,040
Excuse me!

349
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,380
- Please just go.
- Passenger,

350
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,870
you shouldn't do that.

351
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,170
- Pardon me?
- The lady is hanging on to you.

352
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,260
You should make up.

353
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,800
Let's leave, don't concern yourself with it.

354
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,590
You'll be punished for it.

355
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,010
Haven't you heard? Hell has no fury
like a woman scorned.

356
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,980
Losing is winning.

357
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,130
Just close your eyes this once and...

358
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,410
What is it?

359
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,070
How can you just leave?

360
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,530
I've already paid the hospital bills.

361
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,590
Since it wasn't much you don't need
to feel burdened.

362
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,460
That's not it, I don't have my bag or
any money, if you just leave like that...

363
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,360
Don't you have any family?

364
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,030
Even if I do I couldn't call them.

365
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,860
How could I tell them that I was brought to
the emergency room due to alcohol shock?

366
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,410
Then what do you want from me?

367
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,830
Oh, you want money to get home?

368
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,110
Do I look like some kind of beggar?

369
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,010
What is it then?

370
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,880
Let's go to the Kangnam club together.

371
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,450
When I get my bag, I'll pay back
the hospital fees.

372
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,170
There's no need for that.

373
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,470
It's because I'm thankful.

374
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,760
You saved my life.

375
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,020
Why don't you want to?

376
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,190
I'm saying I'll give you money.

377
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,610
I told you it wasn't much.

378
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,380
It's because I'm not comfortable with it.

379
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,740
Then stay uncomfortable.

380
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,450
Wait, if you can't go together, at least
give me your phone number.

381
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,680
I'll transfer the funds.

382
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,330
Let's not overdo it, you don't look like
a person with that much shame.

383
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,470
I don't look like a person with much shame?

384
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,170
He doesn't... think I'm coming on
to him, does he?

385
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,880
Unbelievable, who does he take me as?

386
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,930
Where is my money?

387
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,390
Welcome.

388
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,140
President!

389
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,850
Hello.

390
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,180
Hello.

391
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,030
What's with his clothes?

392
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,640
This is the first time I'm seeing him
out of a suit.

393
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,880
You're early.

394
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,440
Oh... have you met Sang Hee?

395
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,720
Let them know downstairs to
bring up some clothes.

396
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,100
<i>Yes.</i>

397
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,630
Looks like he wasn't able to meet him.

398
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,740
I should've taken him.

399
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,380
I didn't sleep at all, I feel like death.

400
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,670
What were you doing that you couldn't sleep?

401
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,200
What are you doing here this early
in the morning?

402
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,930
You haven't forgotten your promise today,
right?

403
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,370
Meeting Chairman Lee's daughter.

404
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,450
Oh, that?

405
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,650
Yes, that.

406
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,950
I'm going, I said I would.

407
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,000
- Don't go halfheartedly, be serious.
- Aunt.

408
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,030
I mean, President.

409
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,620
I'm really serious.

410
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,970
Don't try to sweet talk your way out.

411
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,560
That's Sang Hee's expertise.

412
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,980
How much longer is he going to play
hide-and-seek?

413
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,290
Is he still at Castile or whatever in Spain?

414
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,880
He's back in Seoul.

415
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,350
When?

416
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,120
Yesterday afternoon I verified he came in
through Incheon Airport.

417
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,160
Don't look for him.

418
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:48,290
Until he apologizes and walks in on his
own two feet, don't look for him.

419
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,570
Really?

420
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,960
What is it?

421
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,230
He's your little brother.

422
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,220
Mine didn't worry me like this.

423
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,260
What's wrong with your brother?

424
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,780
Sang Hee didn't take after father,
he took after you.

425
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,550
You little...

426
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,950
That's what dad said, take it up with him.

427
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,550
If I knew that you two would
worry me like this...

428
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,340
What's the use of regretting it after
twenty years have passed?

429
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,570
Chairman Lee's daughter,
she's a decent girl.

430
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,720
Meet her, and if she's acceptable,
get married.

431
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,580
Sure, to a man in business,
a wife is a necessity.

432
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,200
Such words...

433
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,180
You, if you don't get married
within this year,

434
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,510
I'm going to chase you out of that position.

435
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,940
You said that last year, too.

436
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,100
I'm serious this time!

437
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,540
Are you going to stay here?

438
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,460
You didn't go home last night?

439
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,640
Why?

440
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,660
Do you have a woman?

441
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,950
Who is it?

442
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,260
How could it come out to 270,000 won?

443
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,120
Did they add on that weird guy's tab?

444
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,270
Professor Kong.

445
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,530
It turned off!
What do I do!

446
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,760
Professor Kong, you worried a lot, right?

447
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,560
I was going to call you but this phone...

448
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,920
Oh, you came?

449
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,070
What are you doing?

450
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,470
The toenail keeps digging into my skin.

451
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,290
What?

452
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,200
How can you be worried about that?

453
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,980
Are you dying of pain?

454
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,130
Your daughter didn't come back with even
a phone call, weren't you even worried?

455
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,040
Why should I worry about that?

456
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,400
I would be more worried if my daughter who's
almost thirty comes in every day on time.

457
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,000
What kind of dad are you?

458
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,320
If it was any other dad,

459
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,510
they would've called the police and it
would've caused a huge uproar.

460
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,600
Aigoo... and you consider yourself
any other daughter?

461
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,290
Really...

462
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,540
You were on the news yesterday.

463
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,400
Really? Did you record it?

464
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,040
This is all?

465
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,640
Is there something else?

466
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,760
They didn't show my interview?

467
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,840
You did things like that, too?

468
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,300
My head... it's so itchy.

469
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,410
Oh dear, it's still red!

470
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,210
It must hurt a lot.
Did you go to the hospital?

471
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,000
Where are you going?
You just got back!

472
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,590
Oh! It's that ahjumma from yesterday!

473
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,570
Who are you calling ahjumma!
It's noona...

474
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,920
Yesterday I saw you on TV.

475
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,310
Your videos are even on the internet.

476
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,060
You were pretty...

477
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,220
Hello, what style would you like?

478
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,450
Just, make it so that no one
can recognize me.

479
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,700
Excuse me?

480
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,740
Completely different from now.

481
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,260
Then you came to the wrong place.

482
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,460
You should've gone to a plastic surgeon.

483
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,580
In any case, I'll leave it up to you
to completely change me.

484
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,410
All right.

485
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,800
<i>Yeah... I understand.</i>

486
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,070
<i>I said I understand.</i>

487
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,720
Honey, what time are you coming in today?

488
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:17,520
No, I'm telling you to come early.

489
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,020
We've been in a lull lately...

490
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,470
So, tonight, how about a fiery bed?

491
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,100
Oh, really!

492
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,200
<i>Please come in early.</i>

493
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,050
What to do!

494
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,850
<i>Fiery bed?</i>

495
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,130
<i>These ahjummas...</i>

496
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,590
<i>It's that bastard!</i>

497
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,660
<i>Hyun Ki Jun.</i>

498
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,170
<i>"The young enterpriser to lead Korea."</i>

499
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,230
On whose watch?

500
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,410
They completely photoshopped him.

501
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,640
Cut the jaw...

502
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,820
<i>It's a bit much to say on the first meeting,
but you look much better in person.</i>

503
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,600
I saw your article in a magazine.

504
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,490
You were picked as one of the young
enterprisers who represent Korea.

505
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,360
Our PR department doesn't promote our hotel
but are good at selling their president.

506
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,270
They're quite competent. They have sense.

507
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,600
Have you been to a lot of these meetings?

508
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,120
No. It's a first.

509
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,060
I've been to many, at the nagging
of my elders.

510
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,990
I see.

511
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,820
Since this is your first time,
I'll make the first move.

512
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,360
What kind of woman do you want?

513
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,010
A woman who knows what it means
to be Hyun Ki Jun's wife.

514
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,220
I'm responsible for many things,

515
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,020
and I'll continue to take responsibility
for much more.

516
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,340
So, I'd like her to be a person

517
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,990
who will stay quietly by my side
so that I can hold my ground.

518
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,730
Your sense of responsibility
is quite impressive.

519
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,020
Unfortunately.

520
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:29,550
I heard that you were engaged before
and then broke it off.

521
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,590
Can I ask why you broke it off?

522
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,590
<i>"Hyun Ki Jun,</i>

523
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,320
do you know that in South Korea
he's a man hotter than Hyun Bin."

524
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,580
- He is more popular than Hyun Bin. We like...
- Kong Ah Jung?

525
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,900
Oh dear, it is you!

526
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,920
My goodness.
How long has it been?

527
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,220
<i>Yoo. So. Ran.</i>

528
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,490
Right, has it been about three years?

529
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,270
Has it been three years?

530
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,780
Then after that thing, it's the first time
we're seeing each other.

531
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,270
Yeah, it's the first after that thing.

532
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,470

533
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,670
We were really close back then.

534
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,910
We were too much.

536
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,650
<i>Too much?
Unbelievable.</i>

537
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,420
Right... it was a bit awkward
to stay in touch.

538
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,800
How have you been?

539
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,840
I haven't heard about you at all.

540
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,300
As you can see I've been well.

541
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,650
Honey! Here!

542
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,420
<i>Honey?</i>

543
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,690
You don't need to worry about that.

544
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,720
Hey! Hey! Don't call him over!

545
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,460
Why?

546
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,120
Just don't call him over!

547
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,930
Hey, where are you going?

548
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,160
It's been a while since you've
seen him, too.

549
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,840
Look who I ran into.

550
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,320
Ah Jung.

551
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,410

their first love again.</i>

553
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,820
<i>But, why does it have to be now?</i>

554
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,630
Is it really Ah Jung?

555
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,360
It's been a while.

556
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,660
Seeing you like this I couldn't
recognize you at all.

557
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,180
Ah Jung, what's wrong with you?
It's not like you to be so shy.

558
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,400
You went around perfectly fine without
washing your hair for a week.

I should've just died.</i>

Oh, right. Ah Jung, have you married?

565
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,780
Dear, come on, what do you mean married?

566
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,660
It's Ah Jung.

567
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,260
What do you mean?
You haven't gotten married yet?

568
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,590
That's a problem.

569
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,610
Not again, Ah Jung's going to cry.

<i>Oh, sorry, it's just a joke.</i>

571
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,880
And a good person will come.

<i>It's not that great to get married
early anyway.</i>

No, it's not that I don't like it,
it's because I'm shy.

Yeah, okay, then I'll see you later.
Do you need anything?

All right, I'll see you a bit later.

Ah Jung, congratulations.

588
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,210
Thanks, sunbae.

589
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,840
It hasn't been long since you married,

Did you really get married?
Then how come I didn't know?

592
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,340
Yoo So Ran, were you going to come
to my wedding?

593
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,230
If I knew that, I would've sent you
an invitation.

594
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,730
You would have really come?

595
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,670
We should get going.

596

already done it, got it!

A week?

609
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,850
- Has it been about a week?
- One week?

610
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,500
Everyone's like that around here.

611
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,280
You don't brush your teeth for a day.

612
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,440
Or wash your face for four.
Or wash your hair for a week.

Not taking a bath in a month is common.

- I passed the first test.

Do you think you can pass the second test?

If you pass it'll be a miracle, a miracle.

Maybe you were lucky during the first test
but you'll never get past the second, never!

622
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,850
But, if I work hard with the power of love,
don't you think it'll turn out okay?

623
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,300
- It won't.
- And not because you don't want it to?

Do you see me as someone who wishes ill
for her friend?

So don't act like someone who's
afraid I'll pass.

- Where?

curious about how great he was.

your standards.

Fine, laugh as much as you want.

round and confess to sunbae.

00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,260
It's okay.

708
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,720
Say thank you, give the money, simple.

709
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,920
With honor, even if it's annoying, let's
just do what needs to be done.

710
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,670
<i>He was waiting for me?</i>

711
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,450
Did you finish your phone call?

712
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,730
- Yes, it was a bit long, right?
- Not at all.

713
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,610
<i>What are your hobbies?</i>

714
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,240
I don't have any in particular.

715
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,860
<i>When I have some free time I swim
or go horseback riding.</i>

716
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,890
You like swimming?

717
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:44,360
<i>- I really like swimming.
- Really?</i>

718
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,630
<i>- We should go swimming together sometime.
- Wait for who?</i>

719
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,940
Why am I always like this?

720
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,270
Would you like to order something?

721
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,710
I'm going to leave soon, soon...

722
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,320
Could I have some green tea?

723
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,200
No, tomato juice.

724
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,550
I want to go to the bathroom.

725
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,900
I need to hold it in.

726
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,700
Excuse me, where is the bathroom?

727
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,050
If you go out, it's at the end
of the hallway.

728
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,170
I can't, what if he leaves during that time?

729
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,840
Let's hold it in, you've done well
up until now.

730
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,400
Should I just give it to him and leave?

731
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,950
He's with a woman, it might be
a bit weird...

732
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,240
What are they talking about for so long?

733
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,400
Miss!

734
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,230
Are you okay?
Miss!

735
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,140
<i>Miss!</i>

736
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,430
<i>What do I do?</i>

737
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,410
<i>I can't bear to open my eyes.</i>

738
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,920
<i>Miss, please open your eyes!</i>

739
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,730
<i>Are you okay?</i>

740
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,190
<i>- Please open your eyes.
- Miss?</i>

741
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,050
Look here!

742
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,590
Let go of me!

743
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,740
<i>- What do we do?
- Miss, please open your eyes! Miss!</i>

744
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,100
<i>Miss, are you okay?</i>

745
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,420
Excuse me.

746
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:50,310
<i>Miss? Are you okay?</i>

747
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,550
- Miss, are you okay?
- Please move.

748
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:02,180
<i>What is this?
What's he doing?</i>

749
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,270
Kong Ah Jung!

750
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,580
Excuse me, what's happened?

751
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:24,660
Is she hurt?

752
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,380
No, she spilled some tomato juice.

753
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,070
But, but, why is he carrying her out
like this?

754
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,430
<i>Where are we going?</i>

755
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,600
Call the doctor.

756
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,390
One second.

757
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,080
I'm alive.

758
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,020
It's so hot.

759
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,220
What do I say?

760
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,630
Anemia?

761
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,620
Epileptic seizure?

762
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,660
What do I do?

763
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:45,970
Yes!

764
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,700
<i>How about you come out?</i>

765
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,630
I'm going out.

766
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:05,290
I was sitting for a long time and my legs
fell asleep.

767
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:09,050
It could be a concussion, so let's go
to the hospital, to get an x-ray.

768
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,570
It's okay, I'm really fine.

769
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,170
My head's pretty hard so there
won't be anything wrong.

770
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,500
Let's make sure anyway, it'll be a nuisance
if you start saying something else later on.

771
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,110
Something else?

772
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,810
Oh, since I got hurt here,
give me compensation.

773
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,910
Who do you take me as...

774
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,980
- Do I look like I'm going to threaten you?
- You're not?

775
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,310
You're fine and yet you pretend you
fainted and disrupted our business.

776
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,080
It's because I was embarrassed, satisfied?

777
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:36,590
Then, what about you?

778
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,300
Why did you carry me without my permission?

779
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,170
Are you a pervert?

780
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:42,460
If I didn't carry you out I was afraid
you'd stay like that the entire day.

781
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,390
If it's not on purpose then what is it?

782
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,950
Let's hear the reason you changed
your hair after a day and came here.

783
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:57,190
Here, 73,2000 won.

784
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,380
How did you know who I was?

785
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,390
I saw you in a magazine...
completely photoshopped.

786
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,720
It was hard to even recognize you.

787
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,210
I clearly said it was okay.

788
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:07,330
I'm sorry, but I'm not okay with it.

789
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,980
I'm a government worker.

790
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,210
No matter what the situation is,

791
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,300
accepting services or money
as bribes are forbidden.

792
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,960
I've never offered you my services or money

793
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,330
And especially bribes.

794
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,030
I'm also doing this so that nothing
is skewed and twisted, all right?

795
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,090
I'll be going.

796
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,310
I've done what I came here for.

797
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,890
Are you going to leave like that?

798
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,470
If I go out like this, are you worried
about your hotel's prestige?

799
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,400
I'll tell them to bring another set of
clothes so leave after you've changed.

800
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,610
This is... not a place for a person to stay.

801
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:01,830
Oh no!

802
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,870
What kind of hotel is this?

803
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,320
Miss, are you okay?

804
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,180
Blood!

805
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,140
Is, something funny?

806
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,360
It's not funny but unbelievable.

807
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,330
Do you know her?

808
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,670
Know who?

809
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:20,830
Who is it this early in the morning?

810
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,050
<i>Hyun Sang Hee?</i>

811
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,130
Ah, really.

812
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,450
You haven't moved.

813
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:31,710
It's good.

814
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:35,010
Hyung, this one's nice.

815
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:39,120
Don't say nonsense, your hyung
is looking for you.

816
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,340
Really?

817
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,840
Yesterday... was it yesterday?

818
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,750
The day before yesterday a person came
looking for you.

819
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,770
Where have you been?

820
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,670
Here and there.

821
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,320
I can stay here a bit, right?

822
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,990
You can't.

823
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,090
You have a woman?

824
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,050
Why don't you crawl back home
and stop worrying people!

825
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,080
You moved in here with my help, remember?

826
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:00,230
You said it was an investment.

827
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,240
I'm saying it as part of the investment.

828
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,080
Really, as a chaebol you're
such a cheapskate.

829
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,090
You want to eat ramyun?

830
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:09,200
Ramyun sounds good.

831
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,240
Resignation?

832
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,230
Why is this here?

833
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,800
[Apology]

834
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,500
Why is it a written apology?

835
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,670
You looked like you were going to
turn in your resignation!

836
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,750
I wrote it, but someone stole it from me.

837
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,580
Did you just hear?

838
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,740
She wrote a resignation,
but someone stole it!

839
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:52,670
So someone stole it.

840
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,890
Well, I guess that could happen.

841
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,350
<i>It's strange, isn't it?</i>

842
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:01,830
Even though it's ridiculous, when she
says it, it sounds true.

843
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,520
That's true.

844
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:07,100
That's Kong's charm.

845
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,720
Thief!

846
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,240
I'm the resignation thief!

847
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,660
- Hello.
- Hello.

848
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,530
<i>Married?
Ah Jung?</i>

849
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,770
You guys didn't know either?

850
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,880
If you don't know how would we?
You were the only one close to her.

851
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,780
Well, it's been a while since
I've contacted her, too.

852
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,640
And her husband? What does her husband do?

853
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,150
I didn't ask her, there was no time to.

854
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,950
I'm here.

855
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,710
I heard you went to your future
in-law's house.

856
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,400
You're not even married, why do they keep
ordering you to come and go?

857
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,940
Don't even talk about it.

858
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:42,230
What were you talking about?

859
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,350
Ah Jung.

860
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,250
Kong Ah Jung?

861
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,420
They said she's married.

862
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:49,080
I think that's a complete lie,
a lie to uphold her pride...

863
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,790
It's not.
Hey...

864
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:52,530
I saw Ah Jung's husband.

865
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,800
- You saw him?
- When?

866
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,520
Yesterday at a hotel!

867
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,820
He was really good-looking!
He's totally handsome.

868
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,110
Did she introduce him as her husband?

869
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,080
She didn't, but...

870
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,180
Then how can you know if it's
her husband or not?

871
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,030
Right.

872
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,550
Just because they were at the hotel
together,

873
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,120
does that mean they're all husbands?

874
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:08,190
Hey, hey, hey!

875
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,070
In front of all those people, just because
she got juice on her clothes,

876
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,340
he was carrying her out like this!

877
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,550
It must be her husband, how could it
be a stranger!

878
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,260
<i>Ah Jung's husband is really...</i>

879
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,430
He must not be that great of a person,

880
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,590
seeing as how she got married without
contacting anyone.

881
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:31,750
That's true.

882
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:36,040
If he was a decent guy there would've been
talk, and she would've contacted us.

883
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:37,420
That's right.

884
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,130
I don't think so.

885
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:43,770
A person who wears designer clothes,
do you think he'd be a jobless hobo?

886
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,890
With just one look, you could tell
he has some money!

887
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,560
<i>I'm so envious.</i>

888
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:02,150
Did you hear? Did you hear?

889
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,760
Ah Jung got married!

890
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,540
Yeah! Kong Ah Jung! Have you heard
anything about her husband?

891
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,670
Hey, I saw Ah Jung's husband,
I was so envious!

892
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:16,620
It's true!
Hey, this is huge.

893
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:19,120
Just one look and can tell
he has some money?

894
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,930
What? Husband?

895
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,890
What does her husband do?

896
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,440
Husband?

897
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,610
A chaebol.

898
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:29,510
He's a chaebol, a chaebol!

899
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:30,640
A chaebol!

900
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,730
A man like that... with Ah Jung?!

901
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,560
She married a chaebol!

902
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:35,670
- Chaebol!
- Chaebol!

903
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,160
- Chaebol!
- Chaebol!

904
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,250
- Hotel!
- Resort!

905
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,000
Mall!

906
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,750
<i>Chaebols who have lots of money.
Don't you know, chaebol!</i>

907
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:43,930
<i>Those chaebols who own hotels and malls!</i>

908
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,550
What a joke!

909
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,870
<i>You know Hyun Ki Jun, right?</i>

910
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:50,630
<i>Yes.</i>

911
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:54,280
That Hyun Ki Jun is my friend
Ah Jung's husband.

912
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:54,980
Really?

913
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,730
Oh my!
Hyun Ki Jun is married!

914
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,690
Oh my goodness, Hyun Ki Jun is married!

915
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,190
Hyun Ki Jun is married!

916
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,030
<i>A kid who did nothing but study, is married?</i>

917
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,710
<i>Hotel? Yacht? What a joke.</i>

918
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:06,080
<i>Does anyone get married?</i>

919
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,780
- Hyun Ki Jun is married!
- What? Hyun Ki Jun?

920
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,020
An acquaintance's friend's friend
is his wife!

921
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,080
- No way!
- Good-looking and rich.

922
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:15,520
Right, does it make sense that
Hyun Ki Jun is still single?

923
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,170
Nothing's a secret.

924
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,690
So we meet again here.

925
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,530
I'm sorry.

926
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,640
I was going to call you but I had
a conference so I wasn't able to.

927
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:54,830
Making me your substitute, I was offended.

928
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:55,820
Excuse me?

929
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,170
Don't worry, I won't tell the elders.

930
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,090
What is she talking about?

931
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,530
<i>Hyun Ki Jun!</i>

932
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,540
It's been a while.

933
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,270
How could you not notify us and get married?

934
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,780
Married?

935
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,770
Who?

936
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,000
Me?

937
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,010
That's ridiculous!

<i>Who's the one who spread the rumor?</i>

945
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,010
<i>There's even a woman?</i>

946
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,860
A woman who says she's married to me?

947
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,890
Is this funny?

948
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,980
Let's see each other in court.

949
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,180
Do as you wish.

950
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,470
<i>What are you doing? Let go of me!</i>

951
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:12,250
<i>I just said that I got married,
but I never said to whom!</i>

952
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,940
<i>What a weird woman.</i>

953
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,390
What's so great about marriage.

954
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,540
I feel the same way.

955
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,560
<i>Don't you have to call this fate?</i>

956
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,780
He is being ridiculous.

957
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:24,130
If you let her go it's coincidence,
if you catch her, it's fate.

958
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,010
Hey, Kong Ah Jung!

959
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,350
<i>Don't you think he feels sorry?</i>

960
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:30,650
<i>He's the reason you broke the engagement.</i>

961
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,220
Tell me the truth, you're the one who
spread the rumor, right?

962
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:35,320
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

963
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,890
<i>If I'm the start of it, I should end it.</i>

964
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:38,950
So?

965
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,160
- Look here!
- Save me!

966
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,400
<i>Save me!</i>
